## About the Laravel project (as API)

"Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications."

This project not only uses basic concepts for CRUD operations with the ORM technology but also takes advantage of some strong features such as; Middlewares for saving cache, automatic pagination, and an easy way to integrate filter systems for the data response. The last one can be personalized for more complex queries if needed. All this uses guard security technology with a token key that only works for the user that is authenticated in the server (with a modifiable timer)

## How to start de project

As this project only works as an API server, you will need to use an API Platform such as Postman to test all the query routes.
